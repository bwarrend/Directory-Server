# Directory Server

A simple directory file server written in Python3.  Allows for easy file sharing over HTTP.  Must have port forwarded/triggered.  Enter the port of your choosing.  Choose the file directory.  Click start server.  An HTTP server will launch (pythons http.server or simpleHTTPserver).  Gives you option to copy your external IP + Port so you can paste it to a friend.



##### Issues

If you have an Index.html file, the server will automatically serve that instead of a file directory.  

Unable to download full directories so multiple files need to be downloaded separately or archived
